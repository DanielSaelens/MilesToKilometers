// Insert a code segment after the code weâ€™ve just reviewed:
//
// - Set the existing score variable to 10,000.
// - Set the existing levelCompleted variable to 8.
// - Set the existing bonus variable to 200.
// - Use the same if condition. Meaning if gameOver is true, 
//   then you want to perform the same calculation, and print 
//   out the value of the finalScore variable.
